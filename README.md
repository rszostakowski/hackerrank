10 practical ways to learn algorithms and data structures as a software developer.

The vast majority of us donâ€™t need to know data structures and algorithms inside out, nor how to implement them from scratch. But everyone who writes software should know the basics:

ðŸ‘‰ The most commonly used data structures and their pros and cons.
ðŸ‘‰ The most commonly used algorithms and their strengths and weaknesses.
ðŸ‘‰ The strategies that are used in the design and development of algorithms and data structures.
